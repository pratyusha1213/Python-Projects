# Data Analysis on Coursera Course Dataset

## Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth analysis of Coursera's course dataset, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizing key insights. The analysis aims to discover trends in course ratings, student enrollments, and other course characteristics, as well as make recommendations for improving courses and strategies to maximize student engagement.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about Coursera courses, including:
- **Course Name**
- **Course Rating**
- **Number of Students Enrolled**
- **Other Course Features** 

This dataset is cleaned and processed to remove inconsistencies, and multiple visualization and analysis techniques are applied to uncover valuable insights.

## Project Structure

```

```

- **data/**: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
- **analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook (or Python script) containing the entire analysis process.
- **figures/**: Contains visualizations (graphs, charts) generated from the analysis.

## Data Cleaning

The following data cleaning steps were performed:
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values in the dataset were filled using statistical methods such as mean or median, or removed where necessary.
2. **Outlier Detection and Treatment**: Outliers in `course_rating` and `course_students_enrolled` were identified using box plots and handled through the IQR method to improve data quality.
3. **Standardization and Normalization**: Numeric columns were scaled where necessary to ensure consistency and improve the results of clustering and statistical analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The exploratory data analysis covered:
1. **Distribution Analysis**:
   - Visualizing the distribution of `course_rating` and `course_students_enrolled` using histograms and KDE plots.
   
2. **Outlier Detection**:
   - Identifying outliers using box plots and deciding on their impact.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Heatmaps were used to analyze the correlation between course ratings and student enrollments.

4. **Grouping and Aggregation**:
   - Grouped data by `course_rating` to calculate median enrollments for further insights.

## Key Visualizations

- **Box Plots**: Used to detect outliers in the `course_rating` and `course_students_enrolled` columns.
- **Heatmaps**: To visualize correlations between numerical features, such as `course_rating` and `course_students_enrolled`.
- **Scatter Plots**: To show relationships between key variables such as ratings vs. enrollments.
- **Bar Charts**: To display the frequency of courses per rating category or enrollment range.

## Insights & Recommendations

- **Course Popularity**: Courses with higher ratings and large enrollments were identified, providing insight into what makes a course popular.
- **Course Rating Analysis**: Courses with a rating of 4.5 and above tend to have significantly more enrollments, suggesting a link between course quality and popularity.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Low-rated courses can be improved by updating content or addressing specific feedback.

## Suggestions for Future Work

1. **Further Data Collection**: More features like course completion rates and instructor information would provide additional insight.
2. **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning models could be developed to predict course success based on existing features.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: NLP techniques could be applied to reviews and feedback to understand how students feel about specific courses.

## Running the Code

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for `.ipynb` files)
- Required libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `seaborn`
  - `matplotlib`
  
Install the required packages using:
```
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib 
```

### Steps to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Place the dataset in the `data/` directory.
3. Open the `analysis.ipynb` notebook or run the Python script in your environment.
4. Visualizations will be generated, and insights will be displayed in the notebook.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Coursera course data and highlights key factors that contribute to a course's popularity and success. The visualizations and statistical analyses offer valuable insights into student behavior and course performance, providing guidance for both course creators and platform managers to improve content and engagement.
